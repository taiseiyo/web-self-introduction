	  My name is Taisei Suzuki. I am first year student at Kwansei
	  Gakuin Graduate School. In my research, I have applied
	  machine learning to networks and conducted various
	  experiments, and I have also made presentations overseas.

	<p>
	  I like programming and am working hard every day to improve my
	  abilities. The account name on GitHub is taiseiyo.

	<p>
	  The OS I usually use is Debian from Linux, and I am very
	  familiar with CLI operations. My favorite text editor is
	  Emacs, which I have modified to make programming easier.  My
	  favorite programming language is python, which I use for
	  daily development and research.

	  I'm looking for a companion to talk about programming technology, so
	  please feel free to contact me.
