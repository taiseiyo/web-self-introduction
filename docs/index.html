	  My name is Taisei Suzuki. I am a first year graduate student
	  at Kwansei Gakuin University.  In my research, I have
	  applied machine learning to networks and conducted various
	  experiments, and I have also made presentations overseas.

	<p>
	  We have submitted 7 conference submissions, 2 of which have
	  been submitted to international conferences. In addition, we
	  have received the Student Research Encouragement Award at
	  the "Technical Committee on Internet Architecture (IA)".

	  I like programming and am working hard every day to improve my
	  abilities. The account name on GitHub is taiseiyo.

	  The OS I usually use is Debian from Linux, and I am very
	  familiar with CLI operations. My favorite text editor is
	  Emacs, which I have modified to make programming easier.  My
	  favorite programming language is python, which I use for
	  daily development and research.
	</p></br>
	
	<p>
	  My goal is to use information technology to enrich the lives
	  of many people in the future. Therefore, I spare no effort
	  every day and cherish every day.  I'm looking for a
	  companion to talk about programming technology, so please
	  feel free to contact me.
